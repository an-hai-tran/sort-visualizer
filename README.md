# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a web app that visualizes sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Heap Sort.

You can access it at https://antran416.github.io/sort-visualizer/

You can run this app locally by cloning this repo and install the dependencies:

`$ git clone https://github.com/antran-416/sort-visualizer.git`

`$ cd sort-visualizer`

`$ npm install`

# Purpose

This is my first project with React because I want to learn some new JavaScript library. I also view this as an opportunity for me to revise my knowledge on the classic sorting algorithms.

The yellow color indicates that this element is being transferred to the correct position.\
The red color indicates the element that is being compared to the yellow element.\

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
